## Objectives:
1.Predict the wins by teams in Major League Baseball by using the Multiple Linear Regression model
<br>
2.Analyse the career performance of top batters and pitchers based on the average homeruns and strikeouts by the players individually
<br>
3.Explore the relationship between how many runs a team score and the number of the wins they have. Linear regression and the Decision Tree Regression Algorithm have been used for analytical modelling.
